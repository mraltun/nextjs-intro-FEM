## Folders

/public - Folder for the public assets (e.g favicons, images etc.)

/app - The new way. It's where we put our pages (v13). It supports Layouts (share UI between routes while preserving state and avoid re-renders), React's Server Components (combine client-side apps with the traditional server rendering), streaming (display instant loading states and stream in units of UI as they are rendered), Data Fetching (async Server Components and extended fetch API enables component-level fetching)

/pages - The old way. We put our pages here (still works with v13). Backend (api) folder still inside this folder.
